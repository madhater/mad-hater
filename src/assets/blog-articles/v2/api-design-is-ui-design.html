    API design is UI design
  </h2>
  <p>
    A recurring problem I’ve encountered with service oriented architectures
    is a lack of attention to API design. Too often it seems that back end
    developers treat web service authoring as an escape from business
    requirements, leading to an expectation that they can do what they’ve
    always wanted to do, just write code.
  </p>
  <p>
    The truth is that API design is UI design. To do it right, the same
    design process needs to be followed to ensure it functions well for
    its intended audience. This may sound extreme as the interpretation
    of UI is generally a graphical user interface. However, there isn’t
    necessarily a G in UI, leaving us simply with a user interface. API
    stands for application programming interface, but ultimately until AI
    takes over the world, there is often an end user writing code which
    utilizes your API. This is your user. This could be a front end
    developer, a 3rd party, analytics, data science teams, or countless
    others.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we accept that API design should be treated as UI design, then
    we have to then accept that the design process should be the same.
    So what does that mean and what does it look like?
  </p>
  <h3 class="h6 pb-3 pt-4 mb-4 border-bottom border-dark text-uppercase font-weight-bold">The Process</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Step 1:</b> Know who your users are and communicate with them
    regularly. Ask questions. What works well? What doesn’t? How do we
    get better?
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Step 2:</b> When need arises for a new service or changes to an
    existing service meet with the intended users. Be careful about
    making assumptions about which of your users might consume the
    service. If you aren’t sure, ask. Don’t just jump directly into
    the code. Make sure to understand your end user’s intended goal.
    All of them! What are their priorities? Speed? Accuracy?
    Availability? If you don’t know these things, any service you write
    is going to be a risky adventure with a high likelihood of needing
    to be rewritten. If this sounds a lot like gathering requirements,
    well it should. That’s what you are doing. SOA isn’t a free pass
    to skip this step.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Step 3: </b> Start designing (not coding). If you’re doing REST,
    start writing out your API endpoints. What are the paths? What do the
    request and response objects look like? Not doing REST, that’s fine
    too, but what standard are you following? Is it documented? Are you
    consistently using it? Do you have a review process to ensure it is
    followed? If you aren’t doing these things, likely your services
    live in the wild west. They are probably under utilized, ridden with
    bugs, or you find yourself constantly informing the user that they
    used the service wrong. Side note, if you find yourself telling the
    user they aren’t using a  service correctly on a regular basis, that
    should be a very large warning sign that your design is bad.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Step 4: </b> Formal design review the design with end users and
    other developers. If it doesn’t meet the criteria, go back to step 3
    using that feedback. Note that you should be reviewing the design
    with both groups as part of step 3, this is the step where you are
    looking for a formal sign off from the interested parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Step 5: </b> Now you can start writing code. Since you followed
    the first four steps, it probably won’t suck. Good job.
  </p>
  <h3 class="h6 pb-3 pt-4 mb-4 border-bottom border-dark text-uppercase font-weight-bold">Examples? Sure Why Not</h3>
  <h4 class="h6 font-weight-bold">Example 1 / GET</h4>
  <p>
    api/schoolChecklist/{schoolNumber}/{gender}/{grade}
  </p>
  <p>
    What could possibly go wrong with this? For starters it wasn’t
    documented well, largely consisting of a use case passed to the front
    end developer:<br>
    api/schoolChecklist/999999999/2/2
  </p>
  <p>
    Is it clear that grade should be first and gender second? No, it’s
    not which is why it resulted in a bug later. This is one that
    could have been simply solved by following actual REST standards.
    For starters, the checklist is a unique artifact to the a school and
    a specific grade & gender combination and schools are also necessary
    artifacts.
  </p>
  <p>
    So at a base level, something along the following lines
    would be more appropriate:<br>
    api/school/{schoolNumber}/gender/{gender}/grade/{grade}/checklist<br>
    Making for an example URL of:<br>
    api/school/999999999/gender/2/grade/2/checklist
  </p>
  <p>
    The above is quite a bit less likely to be misinterpreted.
    It also sets up a much more extensible and discoverable API. It
    should come as no surprise that this is a fundamental goal of REST.
    Again, REST doesn’t have to be the goal, but you should be
    following in someones footsteps. There’s lots of great articles
    out there explaining it and other standards, make use of them.
  </p>
  <h4 class="h6 font-weight-bold">Example 2 / GET</h4>
  <p>
    api/reviews?department={department}&category={category}&subCategory={subCategory}
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike the previous example, this is arguable appropriate REST
    syntax. The issue was in how it was intended to be used and the
    content it responded with. The goal was to use it to return a
    list of product reviews for a category page to help augment SEO
    content. The UI this service was supposed to support showed a
    product image, the product name, and a high rated review for that
    product. The review service however took a more literal approach
    to the review service, and didn’t include the product information
    necessary for the UI display.
  </p>
  <p>
    Arguably this service could be combined with a product service
    to derive the display, but that’s another round trip before
    the UI could be rendered. There are ways around this too such
    as using an ESB to gather the two disparate services and
    create a new unique service that combines the data sets. The
    problem was that there was no communication. Performance needs
    were ignored, necessary data wasn’t provided, and ultimately
    those things put the timeline at risk and it became difficult
    to provide a good solution.
