    The Tyranny of Now
  </h2>
  <p>
    As developers, our greatest challenge in all liklihood dealing with
    expectations of immediacy. Our business partners want results and
    they want them now. This often leads to sub-par architecture &
    development decisions riddled with tech debt.
  </p>
  <p>
    This isn't to say that the business decisions driving that are bad.
    Quite to the contrary they are often good. That said, tech debt is bad.
    Always. No Exceptions. However, it may be (and often is) beneficial
    to take on tech debt for financial gain. It turns out that just like
    the financial world, the trick is to make sure that the income
    generated from taking on the debt is sufficient to repay that debt at a
    later date with interest.
  </p>
  <p>
    So how do we gauge when to act quickly and take on tech debt and when
    is it better to do things the Right Wayâ„¢? How do we go about negotiating
    this with our business partners? Our bosses? Our fellow teammates? Well,
    that's pretty damn hard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Honest negotiation between parties and weighing the risk versus the reward
    is incredibly difficult. The two groups don't share a lot of common
    ground which can make it incredibly difficult to have useful conversations.
    In general developers are often not well versed in the financial
    or marketing worlds and the business representatives are similarly not
    well versed in writing code. It is imperative for both parties to
    communicate their respective goals and concerns in a way that the other
    party can understand. Those in leadership positions need to facilitate
    this communication. Above all, the dialog must be in good faith,
    grounded in compassion and honesty.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my experience there are recurring issues that are the wellspring
    for the tyranny of now. Many of these can become feedback loops.
    Most are the result of bad communication, dishonest communication,
    or entirely missing communication.

          The process and culture must change. One way communication will
          always result in demands for the quickest turn around possible.
          IT must have a method of communicating concerns to their
          business peers who must be willing to listen and work towards
          a compromise.

          Communication is a one way street from IT to business. This generally
          comes in the shape of someone in IT overriding all or a majority
          of business decisions. A lesser form of this is an IT member
          saying "I don't know what Jane in marketing does" on a regular
          basis.

          The IT staff needs to pull their heads out of their asses. The
          business + IT = TEAM. You're not going to have a whole lot of

          Business decisions are often not grounded in good financial sense.
          When this happens, there is no increase in income to enable paying
          the debt back. This often leads to taking on more debt to try and
          make up ground and ever increasing pressure for quick results. A
          truly viscous circle as the developers will lose trust in their
          business partners.

          IT leadership must hold the business accountable for providing
          the business value before a feature is started. Once a feature
          is implemented, they must request the business to provide
          metrics on the success or failure of the feature. Features
          which do not provide value should be removed when possible as
          they only contribute to dead support weight slowing down the
          delivery of other features.

          A feature request may provide value, but the value may not be
          significantly tied to immediate implementation. In this instance,
          the correct answer is to avoid a tactical solution geared towards
          speed of delivery and instead do things the right way. Despite
          this, the feature requestor wants the feature as soon as possibe.

          IT leadership must hold the business accountable for providing
          the business value quantified over time to weigh the reward of
          short term versus long term solutions. This value must be taken
          into consideration when determining wether to proceed with a
          quick fix or a long term solution.

          Business partners and/or IT leaders may have no intention of paying
          down the tech debt and are instead focused on maximizing short term
          profits. These individuals will always push for immediate results.
          This tends to align with job hoppers; individuals whose goal is to only
          make themselves look great for a couple years and hop up the ladder to
          their next gig looking like rockstars. Meanwhile those they leave behind
          are burdened with the tech debt they created.

          reach out to their most recent job but also the job before that.

          IT leadership may ignore the warnings of their developers
          about the amount of debt. This can be catastrophic as the continued

          team's ability to meet demands. This back pressure will affect
          the business partners as their requests will take longer and longer
          to complete. Often times this will lead to a mistaken belief that
          the developers are either incompetent or lazy.

          This is likely the most difficult to solve and diagnose. Willful
          ignorance is an incurable disease. However, this one may not be
          the IT leader at all as much as a symptom of unreasonable
          business requests. Tread carefully and make sure this diagnosis
          is correct. If it is and you are an outside party try to
          facilitate communication between the leader and the developers.
          If you are a developer, make sure you are communicating your
          concerns (see below). If none of these work, it may be time to
          move on from this person.

          The developers themselves are not without blame. IT leadership
          will only be able to heed their warnings about tech debt if the

          Developers must communicate with their IT leader. This cannot be
          a bitch session. The feedback needs to be measurable (e.g. this
          will take 2 developers four weeks to do correctly) and re-inforced
          with impact (e.g. we won't be able to implement feature X because we
          took shortcuts in feature Y the year before. We must first fix Y and
          then we can begin work on X). If communication to the business leaders
          is provided by an IT leader, this communication should be passed on to
          the business and taken into account as part of the risk verses reward
          analysis.

          Often times, there is a tendency amongst some developers towards
          perfectionism. This can lead to a steadfast refusal to take on
          tech debt. This leads initially to longer implementations where
          significant financial benefits are likely missed. This in turn can
          further drive pressure on the business which will only reinforce the
          immediacy of their demands. This will escalate tensions,
          deteriorating the ability of the team to perform. Business
          leaders may seek to circumvent this developer leading to
          sub-optimal results and increased tech debt.

          This individual needs to be warned about their behavior. It is
          as important for members of IT to compromise as it is for
          business partners. Ideally the business is providing justification
          for their requests as that should alleviate some of the developer's
          concerns and help them  meet their peers halfway. Some developers
          will never change their viewpoint and may need to be tucked into
          a corner of the code where this attitude doesn't cause significant
          issues. Other times, it may become necessary to let this individual
          go.
