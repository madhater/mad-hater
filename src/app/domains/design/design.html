      A logo created for a frontend development framework I work on in my free
      time. I originally started with the name as a sort of counterpoint to the 
      “cloud”. I tried numerous approaches, at one time giving ligatures a shot 
      since I'd never really created one before. During that process I realized
      one of my attempts looked a lot like a dragon, and that dragon's are 
      creatures of the sky (and awesome). As a piece of technology I used a 
      geometric font in addition to trying to keep the dragon ligature very
      mathematical. I also created some smaller versions where the detail 
      is reduced so they hold up better at those sizes.
